##Project Overview

This project analyzes a mobile sales dataset with details such as brand, model, price, color, and sales figures. The objective is to identify top-performing products, revenue drivers, and customer preferences. I used Excel for data cleaning and exploration, SQL for querying and segmentation, and Power BI for creating an interactive sales dashboard that highlights key business insights.
