## Project Overview

This project analyzes a mobile phone sales dataset to uncover key business insights. The dataset contains details such as product model, brand, price, Age, Gender, color, quantity sold, payment method and sales amount. Using data analysis techniques, I explored sales performance across different dimensions, including product category, customer preferences, and regional trends.
The main goal of this project is to identify:.
+ How Age and Gender impacts customer demand.
+ Sales patterns across colors and product categories.
+ Potential business opportunities for increasing sales.
+ The most preferred payment method.
  
In this analysis, I used pivot table to explore metrics like Total Sales by Color, Payment Method, Gender. I also used Excel for data cleaning and exploration, SQL for querying and segmentation, and Power BI for creating an interactive sales dashboard that highlights key business insights.
